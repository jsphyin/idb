    <p>Deduction games are those that require players to form conclusions based on available premises. These games are quite varied, including several different types of logical reasoning. Cat & Mouse games like Scotland Yard are a type of Deduction game in which players use a set of observations and truthful feedback to narrow down possibilities and catch a constantly moving opponent at the right position. Elimination games like Clue expect players to arrive at the right conclusion after narrowing down possibilities from a large list. Signalling games like Werewolf allow for a set of observations and player-driven feedback (which may not be truthful) to arrive at the right conclusion out of 2-3 main choices. Finally, this Category includes Induction games like Zendo, in which players must derive a general rule out of near infinite possibilities. Social deduction games are a related sub-category that is proving increasingly popular, and includes games with hidden roles and bluffing such as The Resistance and One Night Werewolf.</p>
