{% block model_desc_attribute %}
    <p>Negotiation games explicitly involve and encourage making deals and alliances with other players and backstabbing when appropriate. Winning is rare without participating in these deals.</p>
    <p>Unlike cooperative games, Negotiation games are still largely competitive, while granting players certain times to make mutual agreements through discussion.</p>
    <p>Negotiation also includes bribery, such as is used in Santiago or Power Struggle. In these situations, the negotiation is in the form of a naked offer, which can be accepted or declined.</p>
